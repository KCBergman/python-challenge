# python-challenge
In order to complete this project I made use of a tutoring session with Kourt Bailey, working in a study group with fellow classmates, AskBCS, and researching code on Google. 

In particular, the following information was essential to completing my work:

    1. An AskBCS Learning Assistant session with Sunshine Pavelka helped me add "if previous_total == 0" into my for loop to make sure that my code correctly found the total of all changes, and be able to find the average change by not trying to divide by zero.
    2. This resource helped me figure out how to print my output string to a text file -- https://www.pythontutorial.net/python-basics/python-create-text-file/  
    3. I used the following URL to help create my code for PyPoll: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/37438550/how-can-i-count-occurrences-of-values-in-a-list-of-dicts
    4. In particular, speaking with Kirsten Rain, Aaron Schneberger, Joanna Santana, and Aaron Otto via Slack and virtual study groups helped me figure out using dictionaries as part of the solution for the PyPoll section of the challenge.
    5. From my tutoring session I learned about using "in" to loop through see if a particular value is present within a dictionary, and if it is, add to an ongoing count. And if it isn't, to add the value to the dictionary.
    6. Speaking with Erik Nam and Michael Dendinger during office hours helped me to figure out how to make my second for loop and print statements work in PyPoll. 

I was not able to figure out a way to create one output string for PyPoll, the way I had with PyBank. However, by creating multiple print statements (one that went to a text file, and the otehr that printed to the console), I was able to work around this.
